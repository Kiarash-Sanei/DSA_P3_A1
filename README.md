# Shortest Paths Counter

This program solves the problem of counting the number of different shortest paths between node 1 and node N in an undirected graph.

## Problem Description

Given an undirected graph with N nodes and M edges, the program calculates:
1. The length of the shortest path from node 1 to node N
2. The number of different shortest paths from node 1 to node N
